# Creative-Folks

**Creative-Folks** is a web application built with PHP and MySQL, created as a hands-on learning project based on the book _"PHP & MySQL: Server-side Web Development"_ by **Jon Duckett**.

## 📚 Project Purpose

## 🔧 Technologies

- **PHP** (version aligned with the book's examples)
- **MySQL**
- HTML5 + CSS3 (for basic styling)
- (optional) Apache (e.g., via XAMPP/LAMP/MAMP)

## ⚙️ Local Setup
